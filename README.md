## Security Notice

`NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is exposed to the client. Any environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in Next.js will be available in the browser. If you do not want to expose your TMDB access token to users, remove the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix and use server-side rendering (SSR) or API routes to keep your token secure. Refer to the Next.js documentation for best practices.
